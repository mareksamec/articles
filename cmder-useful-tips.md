## Useful tips for Cmder - aliases and config sourcing ##

*Reloading (sourcing) Cmder config files (aliases, profile etc):*
Easy way this is to run the init.bat which is usually located in vendor folder which can be found in the Cmder root folder. Cmder creates windows cmd variable %CMDER_ROOT% which allows you to refernce to the cmder root. You should be able to relod the init script with this command:

%CMDER_ROOT%\vendor\init.bat

In case this would not work for some reason, you can call the script by using aboslute path. Let's say your Cmder is installed in:

C:\Cmder\

Than you can simply call:
 C:\Cmder\vendor\init.bat

It is also very useful to setup an alias for this, do it quickly. The user alias config is usually stored in this path:
%CMDER_ROOT%\config\user_aliases.cmd

Open it in your favourite text editor and add this line:
init=%CMDER_ROOT%\Cmder\vendor\init.bat

Save the file and restart cmder, or call init.bat as shown above. Now whenever you type "init" in the Cmder command line. All the configs should be reloaded. Keep in mind that if you have two instances (tabs) with Cmder open, the config will be reloaded only in the window where you called the init from.

*More alias tips*
Alias file works similar to linux aliases in bash but the syntax is a bit different. Simple aliases can be assigned likje this: lt=ls -lstr --color=auto. For commands that include (especially when paths with spaces are resolved) you need to use double quotes. Like this:

```
help=cat "%CMDER_ROOT%\config\hotkeys-marek.txt"
gowork=cd "C:\Users\marek\Documents\Work"
```

Second alias above is a simple cd to my work folder. For the cd command to work properly you need to use double quotes. When you want to launch some file using let's say Adobe Acrobat which is installed in the Program Files you can do it like this:
```
fieldman="C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Acrobat Reader DC\Reader\AcroRd32.exe" "C:
    \Users\marek\Documents\Documentation\manuals\field-manual.pdf"
```
*Fast searching with fzf*
Yes fzf can work in Cmder too. You can use it for fast command line shell. If you don't know fzf, check the project git here: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf . Windows binaries can be found in the project releases page here: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf-bin/releases . You have two ways how to install the fzf. Simple way is just to copy fzf.exe to the Cmder bin folder. Every binary in that folder will be automatically added to the Cmder PATH variable. Second way is to downlod it somwhere else and then adding following line to your profile file. Let's assume you have cloned the fzf to the Apps directory in your Documents (it is assumed that you have folder fzf there which contains file fzf.exe):
```
set "PATH=%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Apps\fzf;%PATH%"
```

For fzf to work the windows TERM variable must not be set. It can be done by simply adding follwing line to your profile file:
```
set TERM=
```
Keep in mind that unsetting TERM variable can cause some issues, for instance if you connect to remote linux server via Cmder built in ssh.
