# App tips for Windows power users
 
If you like your Windows workstation or you are forced to use Windows by your employer, here are some app that can boost your productivity and effectiveness. Most of these tools are free and open source or at least have some type of free version available. I have tested these apps under Windows 7 and Windows 10 (with the exception of Double commander which I extensively tested only under Windows 10) and they worked well.

### Autohotkey
Or just AHK in short. This software makes Windows 100% more useful for me. It allows you to map and script your own hotkeys. For instance, this simple mapping will launch Cmder terminal when you press Ctrl + Alt + t

    ; Launch terminal Ctrl + Alt + t
    
    ^!t::
    
    Run, C:\Users\marekuser\Applicaitons\cmder\Cmder.exe

    Return

But you can do much more. This, for instance, launches Outlook 'New message' dialog and adds the content of your clipboard to the **To:** field. Very useful.


    ^+!n::        
    Run, "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\OUTLOOK.EXE" /c ipm.note /m "%clipboard%


My favorite use for AHK is to map keyboard shortcuts to the documents that I open often or map a shortcut that synces my local folder with corporate NAS server via WinSCP. If you are into scripting, you can even write some basic utilities within AutoHotkey. It can, for example, create simple graphical windows, dialogs, and popups. Advanced operations with the system and windows explorer can be done with Windows shell commands (but be careful here, they can mess things up if used wrongly). 

You can check the [documentation](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/AutoHotkey.htm)  or visit the [forums](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/)  to see some other interesting user scripts.
Installation of AHK requires admin rights but you don't need them for regular usage after installation. Loading new scripts into AHK also does not require admin rights but some commands and scripts might not work without admin rights, especially if they modify the registry or some system variables.

### Cmder 

If you are used to GNU/Linux desktops you will most likely miss a good console in Windows. In that case, Cmder might come in handy. It gives you classic windows CMD shell upgraded with some goodies normally available in most Linux terminal emulators. One of the main advantages is nice command history search and command completion thanks to the clink. There are some goodies from git bash console such as git, vim editor and some Linux commands that have a bit clunky alternatives on windows cmd like grep, ls, less and so on. You can also define your own aliases and add other executables such as python, fzf (great command line fuzzy search) and so on. Cmder is a fork of ConEmu so you can add any other consoles that you like and launch them from within Cmder. Take in mind however that not all of them might work as smooth as in ConEmu, last Cmder version I have tried under Windows 10 ( v1.3.10) had a problem with mouse support in Far manager.

### Chocolatey

If you miss Linux-like package management under Windows then Chocolatey is something you should consider. It has it's own quite wide repository of free tools but also proprietary software. For instance typing `choco install doublecmd` in your Windows cmd or PowerShell will install Double Commander application. Chocolatey teams up very well with Cmder. You can set up some useful aliases to speed up the Chocolatey usage even more. The only downside is that it's not as fast and smooth as Linux package managers you might be used to. My experience is that searching sometimes takes quite long a time and installing bigger applications is definitely slower than with apt-get or pacman.

But personally, I still prefer to stare a few seconds on the cmd than open up the web browser, find and download a setup file, get blocked by a corporate firewall, then finding some mirror that is not blocked etc. Please be aware that some corporate firewalls might block Chocolatey or it's repositories as well, in that case, there is not much you can do :-(. Also if you want to install all the software, you need to run Chocolatey from the elevated command prompt (with admin rights). Depending on the company policy, this might sometimes be an issue. It is nevertheless still possible to install Choco without admin rights[install Choco without admin rights](https://chocolatey.org/docs/installation#non-administrative-install)  but then you are able to install only apps that can run in portable mode or apps that do not require admin rights to run (such as Notepad++).

### Total commander

I think most of you have already heard about this program. The main feature is the twin pane view and some basic commands you can use to interact with the files and move them from one pane to the other. Although this setup might look a bit archaic, when you learn the shortcuts you'll become a king of the file management. There are people who use Windows only because there is no full-fledged Total Commander for Linux. Total Commander has integrated archiver, FTP client, great file comparing features and other tools. All this is very useful for power users who don't want to lose time by constantly clicking around in the windows explorer. You can fast edit text files by hitting F4, copy to the other pane by F5 or quickly create a new folder by F7. You can connect to the remote file system or FTP and very conveniently select and copy/upload files there. If you have never used any similar file manager before it might feel a bit uncomfortable but with practice, you can become very fast and effective. You can use it for free but you have to pass an intro window where you have to click on the right number to continue. Alternatively, you can purchase the license at https://www.ghisler.com/.

### Double commander
A very good free alternative to Total Commander. Does not have all the features but you might find it sufficient for your needs. The FTP client is a bit more intuitive in Total commander in my opinion but there are things I like better in doublecmd, especially how the settings are organized. Overall Doublecmd it is still highly customizable and runs both under Linux and Windows so you can transfer your experience between the two systems.

### Vivaldi browser
This browser is built by the people that were behind Opera in its early days and it is very customizable. It is easily controlled by keyboard and unlike other browsers allows you to customize shortcuts, create custom search engines and other useful features. I wrote a separate article about it [here](https://steemit.com/vivaldi/@marek.samec/get-productive-with-vivaldi-browser)  so I won't go into too many details here.  If you want to save time, you can create custom searches to search in the web apps you use every day.  The theme, colors and the browser layout can be adjusted to your liking as well. On the picture below you can see how I have tabs aligned vertically on the left. Although Vivaldi is based on the open source Chromium it looks nothing like Chrome (with exception of few dialog windows and extensions). This might be a downside if you are not a fan of Chromium, but the good thing is that the vast majority of Google Chrome plugins works in Vivaldi.
