How to prepare for a life in relationship
========================


### What I want to convey:
- What can you expect
- What are you (most likely) going to experience
- How do you think you can prepare?
- Calm you down a bit :-)
- How is it like what is great, what is hard
- Life in Marriage, how is it different from  other types of relationships

### Why we believe this topic is important?
- High divorce rate
- Problems in relationships => General unhappiness, stress
- Problems in the family lead to many other problems if left unsolved
- According to some researches main contributing factor to crime, social problems, substance abuse etc.

### What is your expectation? 

Ask the audience
- It's gonna be filled with cute babies and fluffy unicorns
- Heaven and hell
- It's too far away... 
- I'm not into this stuff

_*Research example, expectation of young people*_




### OK, so how is life when you're 30 or above?
I am 30, reaching 30 is not that bad as some people say.
You get a bit wiser
You did some of the stupid things in your teen years and 20s
You already get some experience
Glad even some (mature) people who are 50, 60 told me they would not want to go back
In a way life is easier, but there are new challenges

### Gender and character differences
Character - Japanese animal "horoscope" 
Man vs Woman

### Challenging situations (example)

### Mutual respect, important part of the relationship

### Roles of parents in the 21st century

### Differences now versus the past how parenting and life in the relationship (did not) change
