How to prepare for a life in relationship
========================


### What I want to convey:
- What can you expect
- What are you (most likely) going to experience
- How do you think you can prepare?
- Calm you down a bit :-)
- How is it like what is great, what is hard
- Life in Marriage, how is it different from  other types of relationships

### Why we believe this topic is important?
- High divorce rate
- Problems in relationships => General unhappiness, stress
- Problems in the family lead to many other problems if left unsolved
- According to some researches main contributing factor to crime, social problems, substance abuse etc.

### What is your expectation? 

Ask the audience
- It's gonna be filled with cute babies and fluffy unicorns
- Heaven and hell
- It's too far away... 
- I'm not into this stuff

_*Research example, expectation of young people*_

### My story
Ok so I was a student and I was thinking about following questions:
- How is it like to be a parent?
- How can I prepare for it?
- What if I will not be a good parent?
- How will relationship with my wife change, are we prepared for it?

### What are your thoughts and questions?
(ask the audience)

### OK, so how do I (and other parents) feel right now?
- I am 30, reaching 30 is not that bad as some people say.
- You get a bit wiser
- You did some of the stupid things in your teen years and 20s
- You already get some experience
- Glad even some (mature) people who are 50, 60 told me they would not want to go back
- In a way life is easier, but there are new challenges
- Less in control of your (free) time

### Question
How would you like to feel after X years of stable relationship?


### Gender and character differences
Character - Japanese animal "horoscope" 
Man vs Woman

### Challenging situations (example)

### Mutual respect, important part of the relationship

### Roles of parents in the 21st century

### Differences now versus the past how parenting and life in the relationship (did not) change
